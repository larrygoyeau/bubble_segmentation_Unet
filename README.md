# Bubble Segmentation

If you want to segment foam images from your device, run the notbook 'automatic_segmentation.ipynb' on colab, a window will open to select the images from your devise. To use google colab, I recommend you to use google chrome.

If you want to see how was done the training prosess, open the notbook 'train_model.ipynb', the code is adapted for colab.

All the segmentation process is based on the framework 'segmentation modes' available here:
